- This is my personal website, built using JavaScript with the GSAP library for animations and Python Flask for the backend.
- It also serves as a practice platform to refine my web programming skills.

_Please note that the site may take a bit to load as itâ€™s hosted on a free plan from Render.com. Thank you for your patience!_
